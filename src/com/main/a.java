/*
working of the call back interface:




as we have implemented as call back interface so we muse overdrider the method but the method is that we have override is teh last statemet of the thred so i get called when the thread is bout to completes and in this way we get out data righ

Yes, your explanation makes sense. You've correctly identified the key aspects of how the callback interface works in this context:

The callback interface defines a method (onWeatherDataReceived in this case) that must be overridden by the class implementing the interface (MyFrame).

The method you've overridden (onWeatherDataReceived) is called at a specific point in your code, which is when the API request thread is about to complete its task and has received the data. This ensures that the callback method is executed when the data is available and ready to be processed.

By using the callback mechanism, you've established a way for the API request thread to notify MyFrame (or any other class implementing the interface) that the data retrieval process is complete, and it's time to work with the received data.

In summary, your explanation accurately describes how the callback interface allows you to coordinate the timing of method execution between different parts of your code, ensuring that data processing occurs when the data is available. This is a common and effective pattern for handling asynchronous operations like network requests.
